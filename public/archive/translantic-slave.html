            <p class="text-sm text-[#3C3C3C]">
                Millions of people were captured in Africa by traders or rival groups. Families were torn apart,
                and entire communities lost many members. People were forced onto ships, beginning a dangerous
                journey across the ocean. Many suffered from hunger, fear, and violence even before leaving
                Africa. People were packed tightly together with little room to move, marking the start of a
                brutal voyage known as the <span class="font-bold text-[#FF6F61]">Middle Passage</span>.
                These events left nightmares on African societies and changed the lives of countless individuals.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Middle Passage</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-[#3C3C3C]">
                The Middle Passage was the long and dangerous journey across the Atlantic Ocean. People were
                kept in dark, crowded ships with very little food, water, or sanitation. Many became sick or
                died from disease, exhaustion, or abuse. The journey often lasted weeks or months. Survivors
                were eventually sold at auctions in the Americas. This leg of the trade was notorious for its
                cruelty, suffering, and high death rates, leaving survivors traumatized for the rest of their lives.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Slave Auctions & Plantations</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-[#3C3C3C]">
                After arriving in the Americas, people were sold at <span class="font-bold text-[#388E3C]">auctions</span>.
                Families were often separated, causing heartbreak and despair. They were forced to work on
                <span class="font-bold text-[#388E3C]">plantations</span> growing crops like sugar, cotton, and tobacco.
                Life was extremely harsh, with long hours, poor living conditions, and very little freedom.
                Despite the brutality, enslaved people resisted in many ways, preserving culture, stories, and
                traditions while fighting for survival.
